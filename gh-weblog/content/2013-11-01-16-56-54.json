{"title":"","author":"Pomax","content":"#What am I looking at?\nThis is a web log that's running through github's \"you make a branch called gh-pages and we'll host it on yourname.github.io/reponame\" concept. Each entry is just a code commit (a .json file, to be exact), and is loaded from github into this page. Since entries are just code, when you write a new entry, or edit an existing entry, or delete an entry you no longer want to be public, this page uses the JavaScript GitHub API to simply effect those changes in your github repo. It's like gh-pages inside gh-pages. Sort of.\n\nAnyway, the point is that you don't need anything other than github to make this work. No LAMP stack, or CMS install, just a github account and a gh-pages branch. Done. Weirdly enough, this did not exist yet... and I has some spare time so I wrote it myself.\n\nAuthoring uses Github flavoured Markdown syntax (see [the synax](https://help.github.com/articles/github-flavored-markdown) for the details on that), so posting new entries is really easy, and follows the syntax you are probably already familiar with from your README.md files. If you're not familiar with Markdown: it's basically magic and plain text gets converted to decent looking marked up text. Because you really shouldnt need to know HTML for write some blog entries. Or need TinyMCE.","published":1383350214096,"updated":1383506851994}

{"title":"","author":"Pomax","content":"#Font prototyping\n\nSo I'm working on a cursive, swashed typeface over at [http://pomax.github.io/Cursive-swash-typeface](http://pomax.github.io/Cursive-swash-typeface), and spent part of today doing some refining work - adding some more glyphs, and swapping in slightly nicer outlines for previously committed glyphs. This is mostly a matter of sifting through the many sheets in Photoshop, isolating glyphs, dropping them into [Vector Magic](http://vectormagic.com) to get pretty decent vector outlines, and then dropping those into [FontCreator](http://www.high-logic.com/font-editor/fontcreator.html).\n\nSo what's the result so far?\n\n{{style}}\n@font-face {\n  font-family: cursivefont;\n  src: url(https://pomax.github.io/Cursive-swash-typeface/Tester.woff) format('WOFF');\n} \n.woffed {\n  font-family: cursivefont;\n  -webkit-font-feature-settings: 'liga';\n  -moz-font-feature-settings: 'liga=1';\n  -moz-font-feature-settings: 'liga';\n  -ms-font-feature-settings: 'liga' 1;\n  -o-font-feature-settings: 'liga';\n  font-feature-settings: 'liga';\n}\np.woffed {\n  padding: 1em 2em;\n  font-size: 110%;\n  box-shadow: 8px 8px 25px 1px lightgrey;\n}\n{{/style}}\n\n<p class=\"woffed\">The result would be this. A cursive font with swashes, as well as ligatures to help deal with swash collisions in things like ll, pp, gg, yp, and other combinations. The list is not exhaustive at the moment, and I'm still trying to figure out how to work in the most defining feature of the typeface: the bar on the 't' should extend over any glyph that doesn't have a vertical that blocks it. Really easy to do on paper, somewhat of a puzzle in OpenType.</p>","tags":["no tags yet"],"published":1397188962389,"updated":1397190286553}

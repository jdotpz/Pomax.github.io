{"title":"","author":"Pomax","content":"#Keeping things https\n\nI hate mixed content. Properly. If there was a button I could pressed that forced browsers to reset to a \"pre mixed-content\" world, I'd press it twice.\n\nFirst of all, I understand what SSL connections offer in terms of security, and what they don't.  What they do, is offer in-transit protection of data. If I request resource X from server Y, then that's usually over a good ten or more \"hops\". On a non-secured connection, anyone who happens to see the data fly by can modify it that data and then send on the modified data. That's potentially bad (someone could change that JS library you're using to snoop for session information and send it to a aggregation service, for instance). Using a secured connection, that's impossible to do (sort of) because the data being sent back and forth is encrypted. In order to modify that JS library, a third party now needs to first decode the response from the server, modify it, and then reencode it with the same set of \"keys\". Impossible, right?\n\nWell, no. If that third party was listening the entire time, they have the entire agreement your browser made with the remote server, including the keys you exchanged, and the encryption protocol you agreed on.  And in a simple act, https has been defeated. The idea that a \"man in the middle\" is only going to be looking for packets being sent for \"something that can be modified for great evil\" is nonsense. If the machine in between you and the server you talk to is compromised, you can bank on the fact that they are looking at all the packets, and work with full sessions. Why? Because that's where you make crime money. And if it makes money, that's what you do.","tags":["no tags yet"],"published":1395360750136,"updated":1395361241490}

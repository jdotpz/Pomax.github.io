{"title":"","author":"Pomax","content":"#Bower.io and Processing.js, finally properly matched\n\n[Processing.js](http://processingjs.org) has an unfortunate association with [John Resig](http://ejohn.org) (he of jQuery fame), to the degree that people have been setting up bower registry entries that point to his, by now heavily outdated, Processing.js repository on Github.\n\nProcessing.js moved on since 1.4.0 (quite a bit, actually) so today I updated the [official Processing-js repository](https://github.com/processing-js/processing-js) with a bower.json for the most up to date version, and registered the project as \"Processing.js\" with bower. That means you can now simply do:\n\n`bower install Processing.js`\n\nand you'll be on the most up to date version of Processing.js -- no questions asked, it's just there for you to use in your bower_components directory.\n\nI'm treating this as a first step towards making Processing.js something that we can release on a rolling schedule, where PR mergers simply lead to a version bump, and you can always have the latest and greatest in terms of Processing.js capabilities.\n\n(And no, there is no API only version available anymore. The project underwent a heavy refactor to make it more module based, and node.js compilable, one of the things that did not survive that process was the dedicated API only version)","tags":["no tags yet"],"published":1395352725980,"updated":1395353061476}

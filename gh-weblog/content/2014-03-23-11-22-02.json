{"title":"","author":"Pomax","content":"#Updates to node-flickrapi\n\nA while ago I wrote [a JavaScript implementation](https://github.com/pomax/node-flickrapi) of the [Flickr API ](http://www.flickr.com/services/api/) for [Node.js](http://nodejs.org) as well as for the browser. I did so, because I wanted to mirror my Flickr content to my own hard disk and discovered that there were no tools that actually let me do that without either paying lots of money (and then discovering they were still shitty tools) or having to actually implement an entire application on top because the only thing on offer was literally, just the API.\n\nSo my implementation was the Flickr API plus a downsync layer that as only baked in functionality would use itself to download all the data associated with a single user. That was insanely handy, but in order to download private data you need to be authenticated, and so the Flickr API running in Node.js would always perform [oauth](https://www.flickr.com/services/api/auth.oauth.html) authentication. Then someone went \"why?\"\n\nWhy indeed? There's plenty of methods in the Flickr API that do not require being authenticated, you just need to have an API key (which is free) and off you go, search for all the red panda pictures that you like (I'm not the only one who does that, right?). But my code did not allow for this...\n\nWell, now it does. I just released version 0.3.14 of the library, which adds a `Flickr.tokenOnly(options, function(err, flickrapi){....})` function for simply setting up an unauthenticated instance for talking to the public parts of the Flickr API. If that sounds useful, then go update your installed version through `npm`! Or of you're not using it yet, git it a shot. And if you want a local mirror of your Flickr stuff, you might also be interested in setting up your own FlickrMirror. It's pretty easy, and having your own content browsable locally, with customisable styling, is plain nice. \n\nBecause not everyone loves what Yahoo!'s done to Flickr.","tags":["no tags yet"],"published":1395598922674,"updated":1395599599548}

{"title":"","author":"Pomax","content":"#Making Mozilla Webmaker's Thimble a little better\n\nThe last two weeks I've been working on making Thimble do something that we've wanted it to do for a long time: mixed content proxying. You might not know what that means, but you'll be familiar with what it does if you've ever used Thimble and you used, say, a Flickr image as a CSS background for something. Instead of seeing a nice image background, the browser would go \"this is mixed content, I will not load this\", and there you are.\n\nStuck. \n\nYour normal recourse would be to try to find an https version of the image you were using, but let's be honest: this is ridiculous. We just want an image background, why would you need to find an https version, just load the damn thing already! Well, now we can.\n\nAs of today, Thimble's staging server has been hooked up to a special proxy that can \"relay\" http resources (images, .css files, and .js files) on an https connection, so that you no longer get the mixed content warning, and things just work.","tags":["no tags yet"],"published":1395439049236,"updated":1395439239532}

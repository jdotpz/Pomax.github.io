{"title":"","author":"Pomax","content":"#Catmull-Rom curve fitting.\n\nI extended my [article on Bezier curves](http://pomax.github.io/bezierinfo) with a section on how to fit a [Catmull-Rom curve to three points](http://pomax.github.io/bezierinfo/#catmullmoulding). There was already a section on how to fit a Bezier curve to three points, but Catmull-Rom curves are another flavour of Hermite curve with different properties, sometimes better suited for coming up with curve parameterisations, and trivially convertible to Bezier curves (and back).\n\nThe section's still missing the actual mathematical explanation of what's going on, and the tweakable parameters that it talks about (so that you live-update the interactive graphic while playing with the parameters), but for now this will do.\n\nAnd to paraphrase Wil Wheaton: \"until next time, and in the mean time: code more Math!\"","tags":["no tags yet"],"published":1397167307456,"updated":1397167494057}

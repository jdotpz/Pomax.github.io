{"title":"","author":"Pomax","content":"# Authentication\nThere's an authentication \"link\" at the top (it currently looks like a dotted circle) that you can click and then input your github application token. These tokens are tied to your own repo, so while you'll see the \"admin\" buttons if you authenticate with a wrong key, the actual updates to github will get rejected.\n\n# Rebuilding the gh-page site\nAnother interesting thing is that because gh-pages don't instantly rebuild, you can't immediately link someone to the page after you posted an entry. Think of it as a cool-down period (or a bug. Either works, but a cool-down period is nicer).\n\n# Manual updates\nIt's just a code repo, so you can do as much manual work as you like by just doing a **git pull**, editing/removing/whathaveyou to your heart's content, and then pushing that up to the gh-pages branch. It's just code.\n\n# Okay, so who are you?\nI'm Pomax. I work for Mozilla on [webmaker](https://webmaker.org), and dabble on the side (I wrote a fairly lengthy article on [Bezier curve math](http://pomax.github.io/bezierinfo) a while back, and did some [font work](http://pomax.nihongoresources.com/pages/Font.js) that you may or may not have heard of). You can reach me on IRC as \"Pomax\" on irc.mozilla.org, or about 10 other servers I idle on, as well as on github. Or if you prefer social media, you can find me in the tweeterspace as [@TheRealPomax](https://twitter.com/TheRealPomax).","published":1383243996314,"updated":1383349705441}

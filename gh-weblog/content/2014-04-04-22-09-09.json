{"title":"","author":"Pomax","content":"#Prototyping a font\n\nI'm working on a [cursive, swashed typeface](), and have been looking for tools that let me turn pages and pages of written letters into at least basic visualisable type. \n\nTurns out that the tool I was looking for is High-Logic's FontCreator. Their autotracer is really nice, and kicks in when you paste in a bitmap from something like Photoshop, so my prototyping workflow right now is \"write the hell out of this typeface\", scan it at a high dpi, then find a decent looking glyph representative, isolate it and paste it over. That's... well, pretty much it.\n\nThat means that I've been able to go from this:\n\n<img src=\"sheet.jpg\" alt=\"a sheet of letters\">\n\nto this:\n\n<img src=\"prototype-font.jpg\" alt=\"a functioning font based on the sheet\">\n\nin about an hour. That's a [picture of a webpage](http://pomax.github.io/Cursive-swash-typeface) btw. Webfonts for the win.","tags":["no tags yet"],"published":1396674549697,"updated":1396675016773}

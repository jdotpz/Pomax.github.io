{"title":"","author":"Pomax","content":"#Taking a road trip or a camera\n\nWe went on a 10 day Northern California road trip,  and brought a camera. This turned out to be a good idea, and a bad idea, because we ended up with some 3200 photographs to sift through afterwards. If you're a casual shooter, that's insane.

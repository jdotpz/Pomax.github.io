{"title":"","author":"Pomax","content":"#Take a road trip or a camera\n\nWe went on a 10 day Northern California road trip,  and brought a camera. This turned out to be a good idea, and a bad idea, because we saw some amazing things, and ended up with some 3200 photographs to sift through afterwards.\n\nIf you're a casual shooter, that's insane. If you're a professional photographer you might think \"eh, bracket shots and the like, 1-in-10~15 recovery of what ends up a decent shot, the rest is cutting room floor\" and you'd be closer to the truth.  Out of the 3200ish photos, so far 460 made it as \"worth keeping\", and there's about 300 photos left for me to run through,  so it's actually more of a 1-in-6.5 ratio. But each photograph has to be evaluated and in the end what was a 10 day road trip has been over two weeks of sifting through photos in the evenings, post-processing them, labeling and tagging them, and then posting them online with descriptions, and organised in sets and collections.\n\nBottom line: take a road trip or a camera. Taking both may end up requiring a second vacation =)\n\nThe trip, in order of places visited, can be found <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/pomax/collections/72157644609698025\">here</a>, and will be extended with two more sets (three, if some photos that were taken with my camera but not by me end up published through my account) at the time of writing this post. Also it was our anniversary.\n\n<img src=\"https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5582/14153437085_e0cc89b5e6_c.jpg\" width=\"80%\" height=\"80%\">","tags":["no tags yet"],"published":1400543819872,"updated":1400607326991}

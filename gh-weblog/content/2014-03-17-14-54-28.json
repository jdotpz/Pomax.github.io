[Hyper physics](http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/solar/retromars.html) has a nice description of this on their site (with pictures!).\n\nI like these kind of quirks, so I whipped up a little [Processing](http://processing.org) sketch that models arbitrary arc-projections, with keyboard interactivitity, to demonstrate what happens when you look at a body moving along an arc path, while moving along an arc path yourself, too. Head over to [this jsbin](http://jsbin.com/gurasuve/1) to play with it.","tags":["Processing","physics","maths"],"published":1395093268989,"updated":1395094358224}

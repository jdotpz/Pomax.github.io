{"title":"","author":"Pomax","content":"#A blog? About time, wouldn't you say?\n\nI am not a fan of most blogging software, because it requires too much work. If it's not \"hit 'new post' button, done\", it's frankly too much work for me. And as it turns out, I now have exactly what I want, using the magic of GitHub's \"user.github.io\" concept, the octokit library (https://github.com/philschatz/octokit.js) for interfacing with github from the browser, and the \"marked\" markdown parser (https://github.com/chjj/marked).\n\nLet me explain what I mean. Logging into the admin panel for this site is... well it doesn't exist. Instead there's a display:none button that lets me type my github password, which gets stored in localStorage. Having my password there lets me add new entries, edit current entries, or delete entries. To edit an entry, I click it. That's it. I click it, it turns into an editable textarea, I change whatever I want, I click outside of it anywhere, and it saves the changes to github. As a standard github commit.\n\nIn fact, the entire blog is just a github repository: http://github.com/Pomax/pomax.github.io has a single branch, \"master\", and its content is literally this blog. If I write entries, they end up in the /content directory. If I delete them, they get deleted. What more do you need?","published":1394168624375,"updated":1394170734184}
